# Observations

These observations were made on the output of 06799077fb2248d331d38b7310b4aa1e53af8a3d

- I've chnaged my mind on the instructions I gave - there should be separate PDFs for each of the 7 items under https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery:
  - Digital Service Toolkit
  - Government Technology Platforms
  - State Digital Assets
  - etc

- the hyperlinks go to the webpage, but they should go to the equivalent place in the document. For example, on page 8 of the output, "write in plain language" links to https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery/digital-service-toolkit/resources/writing-content/content-101/writing-style. Instead, that page should have been included in the PDF, and the link should go to the location of that content within the PDF, so that it's not dependent on the webpage being available. 

- The PDF should be generated as a GitHub action, which is triggered whenever a push to main happens.
