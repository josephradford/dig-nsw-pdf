- The sections in Digital Service Toolkit are not in the expected order. It should be left to right and top to bottom of what's shown on https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery/digital-service-toolkit. How is ordering decided at the moment? I haven't checked the other documents, check that the same ordering logic is applied to all documents.

- In Digital Service Toolkit, can all headings nested inside "Digital Service Toolkit" be lifted up one level? It's hard for me to explain, but do you get me? This nesting is redundant as the title of the whole document is "Digital Service Toolkit". This should be applied to all documents.
